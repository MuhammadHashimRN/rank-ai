2. **user_roles:** Role-based access control (admin, recruiter, viewer)
3. **jobs:** Job postings with requirements and descriptions
4. **resumes:** Uploaded candidate resumes with parsed data
5. **resume_rankings:** AI-generated scores and analysis per job-resume pair
6. **candidate_notes:** Collaborative notes on candidates
7. **candidate_favorites:** Team member favorites/shortlists
8. **skill_synonyms:** Skill normalization taxonomy

**Security Implementation:**

4. Edge function calls AI API for document extraction
5. Parsed data (name, email, skills, experience) stored in `resumes` table
6. User selects job for ranking
7. `rank-resume` function retrieves job requirements and resume data
8. Skills normalized using taxonomy (e.g., "React.js" → "React")
9. AI generates semantic match score and detailed analysis
10. Results stored in `resume_rankings` table
11. Real-time UI update displays ranking with breakdown

## 4. Key Features Implementation

### 4.1 AI-Powered Resume Parsing
**Challenge:** Extract structured data from unstructured documents in various formats.

**Solution:**
- Integrated Lovable AI API for multi-format document parsing
- Edge function handles file retrieval and API communication
- Extracts: candidate name, email, phone, skills array, years of experience
- Error handling with detailed user feedback
- Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT formats

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Edge function calls AI API with resume content
const response = await fetch('https://api.lovable.app/v1/ai/parse-document', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ content: base64Content, format: fileExtension })
});
```

### 4.2 Intelligent Candidate Ranking
**Challenge:** Match candidates to jobs using semantic understanding, not just keyword matching.

**Solution:**
- AI analyzes job description context and candidate background
- Generates 0-100 match score with detailed breakdown
- Provides reasoning: strengths, gaps, recommendations
- Skill normalization prevents false negatives (e.g., "JavaScript" vs "JS")

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
- Skills overlap (normalized)
- Experience level alignment
- Cultural fit indicators
- Growth potential

### 4.3 Skills Taxonomy & Normalization
**Challenge:** Different candidates use different terms for the same skill.

**Solution:**
- Created `skill_synonyms` table mapping variations to canonical forms
- PostgreSQL function `normalize_skill()` for real-time normalization
- Suggestions shown during job creation
- Expandable taxonomy via admin interface

**Examples:**
- "React.js", "ReactJS", "React JS" → "React"
- "Node", "NodeJS", "Node.js" → "Node.js"
- "AI", "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning" → "AI/ML"

### 4.4 Collaborative Features
